# Group Report: Soft-Solid Particle Simulation Project

In this project, a simulation codebase for a 2D elastic Lennard-Jones model has been implemented using python. Most importantly, the code is able to generate videos of the particle systems and also plot the progression of the ordering parameter $\Phi$, which is defined as the fraction of particles in the system that are part of a so-called high-density phase (HDP). The particle forces, velocities and positions are calculated using the velocity-Verlet algorithm, a classical Newtonian approach. The initial position of the paricle is a square lattice, where each particle is connected to their 4 neighbours via elastic springs. Furthermore, each particle interacts with every other particle through Lennard-Jones forces. The square-shaped system follows periodic boundary conditions. As a result, the particles behave as if they were moving on the surface of a thorus. The initial conditions are highly tweakable, some of the parameters include:

- The initial lattice constant $g$
- The square root of the particle count $N$
- The temperature T
- The time interval of each simulation step $\Delta t$, resp. $dt$
- The spring constant $k_S$
- The number of total steps, $steps$
- A Lennard-Jones constant $k_{LJ}$
- The critical radius $r_c$, after which the LJ-potential is considered $0$
- The $cutoff\;distance$, that determines which particles are part of a HDP
- $\sigma$, that determines the equilibrium distance $r_0$ of the LJ-potential

Here are some formulas:
    $$F_s(r) = k_S\cdot r$$
    $$F_{LJ}(r) = 24\cdot k_{LJ}\cdot [ (\sigma r)^{-7}-2(\sigma r)^{-13}]$$
    $$r_0=\frac{\sqrt[6]{2}}{\sigma}$$
    $$F_{total} = F_S + F_{LJ}$$

The final version of the project can be found [here](https://github.com/CTL-2023/soft-solid-model-materialgirls/blob/main/soft_solid_20231201.py). A more thorough description of the task is given in the [readme](https://github.com/CTL-2023/soft-solid-model-materialgirls/blob/main/README.md).

## Layout of the Algorithm and Functions
### Create Initial Configuration
Generates the initial $N\times N$-arrays of the particle positions of side length $L=N\cdot g$. The coordinates $[0,\; 0]$ are defined as the center of the system.

    create_initial_configuration(g, N):
        Args:
            g: Initial lattice constant
            N: Square root of the particle count
        Returns:
            numpy.ndarray: NxN-array of X-positions of particles
            numpy.ndarray: Y-positions of particles
            float: System side length L
### Create Initial Velocities
Creates two arrays of randomly distributed particle X-, and Y-speeds. The speeds are Gauss-distributed with $\mu_{x,y}=0$ and $\sigma_{x,y}=\sqrt{T/2}$, meaning that the total kinetic energy will be set by the temperature: $E_{tot} = \sum_{N^2}(v_x^2+v_y^2)=N^2\cdot T$.

    create_initial_velocities(N, T):
        Args:
            T: System temperature
        Returns:
            numpy.ndarray: NxN-array of X-velocities of particles
            numpy.ndarray: Y-velocities of particles
### Thermostat

        Args:
            vx: X-velocities
            vy: Y-velocities
        Returns:

            float: Mean Y-velocity
### Get Distance
Takes the coordinates of two particles as an input and returns the distance vector between particles, the distance scalar and the normalized vector. It considers periodic boundary conditions:
    $$r_x = 
\begin{cases}
    x_2-x_1 & \text{if } x_2-x_1 \leq L/2, \\
    L-(x_2-x_1) & \text{if } x_2-x_1>L/2.
\end{cases}$$

            float: Distance
            list: Normalized vector

        Args:

            k_S: spring constant
        Returns:
            numpy.ndarray: NxN array of spring X-forces
            numpy.ndarray: Y-forces
        Calls:
            get_dist(L, x1, x2, y1, y2)
### Lennard-Jones

### Get Lennard-Jones-Forces Fast
Iterates over every particle and calculates the Lennard-Jones forces to all the following particles. Then adds this force to the first particle $i$ and substracts it from the second particle $i+j>i$ (actio = reactio). In theory, this should speed up the function by a factor of two for large $N$.

    LJ_forces_fast(N, L, X, Y, k_LJ, r_c, sigma):

## How to Run the Code

1.  Make sure, all the neccessary libraries are installed and that you run python3.  The code was successfully run on an M1 MacBook, using MacOS 14.0 and Python 3.11.5. The used non-standard libraries include:
    - numpy         (simplifies array manipulation)
    - matplotlib    (to generate plots)
    - tqdm          (loading bars for time-intensive simulations)
    - imageio.v2    (uses ffmpeg to generate videos)
2.  Create the three folders and reference them in the according constants *'frames_folder'*, *'plots_folder'*, and *'mp4_folder'*.
3.  Decide for a function you want to run, either *molecular_dynamics()* or *phi_vs_T()*. Enter all the parameters of interest. For example, for the first function, the parameters could be chosen as follows:

        g = 3.5                 # Initial lattice constant
        N = 20                  # N^2 is the particle count
        T = 0.2                 # Temperature, usually < 1
        dt = 0.01               # Time step, usually < 0.05
        k_S = 0.05              # Spring constant
        steps = 25_000          # Number of simulated steps
        k_LJ = 1                # Lennard-Jones-prefactor
        r_c = 3.4               # For all r>r_c, the LJ-potential is set to 0
        cutoff_distance = 1.5   # Particles, who have at least one neighbouring particle closer than cutoff_distance contribute to the order parameter
        sigma = 1               # Influences the equilibrium distance (r_0) of the LJ-potential, r_0 = 2^(1/6)/sigma
        r_0 = 2**(1/6)/sigma    # The gradient of the LJ-potential is 0 at r = r_0
        show_grid = True        # Sets if the grid is shown or not
        fast = True             # Sets which get_LJ_forces() function is being used (only makes a small difference for small N). 
4. Call this function and/or any other functions at the very end of the code. Example:

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            delete_folder_contents()     # Deletes all the frames from a previous simulation
            molecular_dynamics()         # Runs the simulation
            create_video(fps=1_200)      # Higher fps speeds up the video
5.  Run the code.

In this example code, 25.000 time steps of a $20\times20$ particle system are simulated, which leads to the functions single_MD_step(), order_parameter(), and visualize_configuration() being called 25.000 times. Finally, the frames are wrapped into a 30fps-mp4, with a simulated 1.200 fps, resulting in a approximate video length of 20 seconds.

## Problems

Keep track of problems and yet unanswered questions so that all group members know where to focus next.
